Land degradation has become one of the world’s most serious environmental challenges. 
Today, an estimated 40% of the global land surface is already degraded, affecting more than 
three billion people and reducing agricultural productivity, incomes, and climate resilience (IPBES, 2018; Wuepper et al., 2021). 
The problem is even more severe in sub-Saharan Africa, where nearly 65% of arable land is degraded. 
This contributes to annual economic losses of 3–5% of GDP and directly undermines the livelihoods of smallholder 
farmers who depend on the land for survival (Gibbs & Salmon, 2015). The Ethiopian Highlands and specifically the Lake Tana Basin 
(about 15,000 km²) are recognized as global hotspots of soil erosion. The combination of steep terrain, intense seasonal rainfall, 
and long-term human pressure has resulted in exceptionally high soil loss, often exceeding 200–300 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ far beyond sustainable 
limits (Hurni et al., 2010; Nyssen et al., 2015; Lemma et al., 2019).
